            <p>I first started baseball sophmore year at PHS the program showed me what hard work and dedication could acomplish. I learned a lot of new things i went from your average outfielder to a starting pitcher.I have many great stories from baseball but one of my greatest was when our entire baseball program went to Camp Pendleton for a program called Camp Goalz. This was a team building camp through military training although stressful was a new experiance for all of us.</p>
