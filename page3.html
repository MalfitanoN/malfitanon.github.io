        <h1 id=subtitle3>Fishing Club Tee Shirt</h1>
        <p id="teeinfo">This project was for my Graphic Design class and the goal was to create a design for the Fishing Club's tee shirts. The winner would get there design on a shirt as well as a fishing trip by Catalina. I ended up winning, how I created my project was in photoshop it was all drawn by hand. The hardest part of the project was just having a unique design since there was so many people but I ended up finding out what I wanted to do. Overall it was one of my favorite projects this year.</p>
